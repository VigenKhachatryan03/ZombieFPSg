# FPS Zombie Shooter Game

Welcome to the FPS Zombie Shooter Game! This Unity project was developed to practice advanced first-person shooter mechanics, enemy AI, and health management.

## Description

In this game, players face waves of zombies that spawn randomly and approach them. The goal is to eliminate the zombies before they reach and attack the player. As the game progresses, more zombies spawn, increasing the difficulty level. The game features a start menu, which allows players to begin the game at their own pace.

## Features

- **FPS Mechanics**: First-person shooter controls with mouse and keyboard for aiming and movement.
- **Zombie AI**: Enemy zombies that dynamically spawn and follow the player, increasing in numbers over time.
- **Health System**: Player health decreases upon contact with zombies, leading to a game over if depleted.
- **Start Menu**: A start menu to initiate gameplay and provide a structured introduction.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The number of zombies increases as time progresses, adding a greater challenge.

## Getting Started

1. Open in Unity (version 2021.3.27f1 LTS or later).
2. Select a scene and then press play to run.

## How to Play

- Use the keyboard and mouse to move and aim in the 3D environment.
- Shoot the zombies before they reach you to avoid losing health.
- Survive as long as possible as the waves of zombies increase.
